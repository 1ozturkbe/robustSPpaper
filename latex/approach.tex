\section{Approach to Solving \gls{rsp}s}

Our approach to solving the \gls{rsp} is the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Solve the \gls{sp} with no uncertainty, initialized by a vector of 1's. We call this solution $x_0$.
    \item Solve the \gls{sp} with a chosen uncertainty set, using $x_0$ as the initial guess.
\end{enumerate}

Step 2 requires the retuning of the \gls{sp} algorithm as follows:
\newline
\newline
Initialize $x_0 = \vec{1}$ \newline
 While $reltol \geq 1e-4$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Substitute $x_i$ as the initial guess to the \gls{sp}.
        \item Find the \gls{rgp} approximation to the \gls{sp} with guess $x_i$.
        \item Solve the \gls{rgp} to obtain $x_{i+1}$.
        \item Calculate $reltol$.
    \end{enumerate}

$reltol$ is the relative change in the objective function value for the \gls{gp}.
The \gls{rsp} algorithm solves reliably for a range of $reltol$s,
but a value of $1e-4$ was chosen for the models evaluated in this paper.

\section{Approach to Solving RSPs}

Our approach to solving the RSP is the following: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Solve the SP with no uncertainty, initialized by a vector of 1's. We call this solution $x_0$.
    \item Solve the SP with a chosen uncertainty set, using $x_0$ as the initial guess. 
\end{enumerate}

Step 2 requires the retuning of the SP algorithm as follows:
\newline
\newline
Initialize $x_0 = \vec{1}$ \newline
 While $reltol \geq 1e-4$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Substitute $x_i$ as the initial guess to the SP. 
        \item Find the RGP approximation to the SP with guess $x_i$.
        \item Solve the RGP to obtain $x_{i+1}$. 
        \item Calculate $reltol$.
    \end{enumerate}

$reltol$ is the relative change in the objective function value for the GP. The RSP algorithm solves reliably for a range of $reltol$s, but a value of $1e-4$ was chosen for the models evaluated in this paper.

\section{Results}

We implement our \gls{rsp} heuristic algorithm on the aforementioned conceptual aircraft design problem.
Our nominal objective function is total fuel consumption, which is
to be minimized given a payload and a range requirement.

\subsection{Mitigation of probability of failure}

The problem is solved for different sizes of box and elliptical uncertainty sets
by varying the parameter $\Gamma$, as defined in Appendix \ref{LP_to_GP}. Mathematically, for box uncertainty,
$\Gamma$ is a measure of the centered width in logspace of the defined parameter uncertainty, normalized by the
standard deviation of the parameter. For elliptical uncertainty, it is the maximum diameter of the Euclidian norm
ball of $u_i$, which is the number of standard deviations of perturbation of each ith parameter from its nominal value.
Intuitively, it is a measure of how much risk is being hedged against. $\Gamma = 0$
implies that all of the parameters take their nominal values with zero uncertainty,
and larger $\Gamma$ protects against more parameter uncertainty, where a box uncertainty is
more conservative than elliptical uncertainty.

The design variables are then fixed for each solution so that the design can be simulated for
different realizations of the uncertain parameters in Table~\ref{tab:uncertainties}
to examine average design performance. In this~\gls{mc} scheme, the random variables
are simulated from independent and identically distributed $3\sigma$ truncated Gaussians.
We simulate from the truncated Gaussian since this makes it possible to
confirm that for $\Gamma = 1$, all simulations of uncertain parameters are feasible.
Designs for each solution in Figure~\ref{fig:probOfFailure} are simulated with the same set
of uncertainty realizations for consistency. \\

\end{figure}

We define the probability of failure of a design is the probability that any constraint
in the design optimization problem is violated in a \gls{mc} simulation.
As expected, Figure \ref{fig:probOfFailure} shows that probability of failure goes to zero as $\Gamma$ increases.
Moreover, using margins would in the best case be as good as using a box uncertainty set, and therefore will lead
to a more conservative soltion with inferior performance.

We performed the analysis above with the Simple Conservaive and Linearized Perturbations methods
as well, whose results are shown in Appendix (TODO: run and post results).

Figure~\ref{compare_signomial} compares the different methodologies in terms of run times,
number of constraints, and average performance.
The Best Pairs and Linearized Perturbations methods achieve good performance,
however the Best Pairs methodology needs the most number of constraints,
while the Linearized perturbations requires the most setup and solve time.
The Simple Conservative formulation is significantly faster than the other formulations
and requires the least number of additional constraints.

\subsection{The Effect of Robustness on Multiobjective Performance}

One of the benefits of convex and difference-of-convex optimization methods is the ability to optimize for
different objectives~\cite{York2018}. As a demonstration, we optimized the aircraft without uncertainty
for 7 different objectives, and show
the non-dimensionalized results in Table~\ref{tab:nondimresults}.

\begin{table}
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
    \csvautobooktabularcenter{figures/objective_table.csv}
    }
\caption{Non-dimensionalized variations in objective values with respect to the aircraft optimized
for different objectives. Objective values were normalized by the total fuel solution.}
    \label{tab:nondimresults}
\end{table}

Since the model is physics based, it is able to accommodate a range of objectives,
even ones that are not often considered such as aspect ratio. The resulting aircraft
also differ drastically with respect to performance and design variables.
As the most extreme example,
the aircraft optimized for time cost has 150 times the engine weight as the aircraft
optimized for total fuel, since a huge amount of power is required to fly fast.

Aside from this caricature example, we further demonstrate the capabilities of \gls{rsp}s in
multiobjective design by considering a more realistic scenario.
We perform the optimization of the aircraft with no uncertainty and ellipsoidal uncertainty ($\Gamma = 1$)
for 4 different objective functions, and plot the results on spider plots.
Spider plots are useful because they allow engineers to see the performance of
different designs in a multi-objective
environment. One way to envision the multi-objective
performance of the aircraft is to consider the area contained within the web defined by the aircraft's
performance; the smaller the web area the better.
Due to the large disparities in the potential values of design variables depending
on objective as shown in Table~\ref{tab:nondimresults}, we chose to demonstrate this using four objective functions
that would be expected to have a high degree of correlation and therefore yield similar aircraft designs. These were
 total (time and fuel) cost, total fuel, takeoff weight and mid-cruise lift-over-drag (L/D).

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width = 0.95\linewidth]{figures/4objradar.png}
    \caption{The spider plots of aircraft optimized for different objectives.
    The bolded titles are the design objectives for each plot, whereas the individual spiderwebs
    show the non-dimensionalized multiobjective performance of the aircraft designed under different
    uncertainty sets.}
    \label{fig:spider}
\end{figure}

In the spider plots in Figure~\ref{fig:spider}, it is possible to see the effect of robustness on
the different worst-case performance metrics of the different aircraft.
For example, for the nominal case, it is possible to see that
the aircraft designed for total fuel performs the best when all four objectives are considered,
assuming that all objectives are weighted equally.
However, this behavior changes when uncertainty is added. An aircraft optimized for total cost
(bottom left graph) with a box uncertainty set (in green) has better worst-case multiobjective performance
compared to an aircraft designed for total fuel with the same uncertainties.

This is an interesting result, because the presence of an uncertainty set is
shown to affect the efficacy of different objective functions to obtain solutions
with the best overall performance. If the three objective functions didn't
have high degree of coupling, that the internal areas of the solution triangles may differ
more significantly. This analysis could also be performed for the mean performance
of the aircraft determined through ~\gls{mc} simulation, but the authors chose
to limit their scope to the worst-case analysis.

\subsection{Risk minimization problems}

All of the previous multi-objective analyses have assumed that we have an
understanding of exactly how much risk we are
willing to tolerate. However, it would also make sense if risk was the objective of our
model. This would suggest the following formulation:

\begin{align*}
    \text{max} &~\Gamma \\
    \text{s.t.}     &~f_i(x,u) \leq 0, i = 1,\ldots,n \\
                    & \norm{u} \leq \Gamma \\
                    &~f_0(x) \leq (1+\delta)f_0^*,~\delta \geq 0 \tag{a}
    \label{eq:goalprogramming}
\end{align*}

where $f_0^*$ is the optimum of the nominal problem in Formulation~\ref{eq:normform}, $\delta$
is a fractional measure of the objective that we are willing to sacrifice for robustness, which
gives $(1+\delta)f_0^*$ as the upper bound on the objective value. Intuitively,
this is a form of goal programming,
where we specify the exact maximum worst-case value of an objective we can tolerate so that the program
risk is acceptable, but in the meanwhile maximize the total size of the uncertainty we can handle.

The problem in Formulation~\ref{eq:goalprogramming} is not equivalent to the problem in Formulation~\ref{eq:normform},
but should yield the same result. As a proof of concept, we perform the same probability of failure
analysis as in Figure~\ref{fig:probOfFailure}, but have the objective bound be an input to the
optimization problem and the $\Gamma$ of the uncertainty set be maximized.

%TODO insert pof plots here

We can also expand this framework to perform multivariate goal programming,
by changing (a) in the formulation~\ref{eq:goalprogramming} to include all
objectives we are interested in.

\begin{align*}
    f_{0,j}(x) \leq (1+\delta_j) f^*_{0,j},~\delta_j \geq 0,~i = 1,\ldots, m
    \label{eq:multigoal}
\end{align*}

The benefit of goal programming is that it allows us to explore multidisciplinary tradeoffs without
having to enumerate the design space along each objective direction, although this method could be
used to do so reliably.

In design it is not obvious whether an objective should in fact be a constraint instead. The most
fundamental choice that an engineer can make in design is what the objective function is, and it is
often the case that there are many potential objectives that are conflicting. The term multiobjective optimization is misleading
because you can only optimize for one objective at once,
and the design is going to be influenced by how engineers qualitatively weight different objectives.
Risk minimization makes these implicit decisions explicit, and empowers engineers to choose
how much performance they would be willing to sacrifice with respect
to optimal but fragile designs to obtain robust designs, gives a prediction of the margin of error
for every parameter that they have to make designs feasible.

\section{Potential Future Work or Studies}

There are a myriad of potential extensions to signomial programming under uncertainty.
In the spirit of helping reduce program risk in aerospace design, the authors make a few observations
and recommendations.

In this study, we do not discriminate between the kinds of constraints violated. However, it would
be possible to rank the severity of constraint violations so as to penalize some (eg. structural safety)
more heavily than others (maximum range constraint). This would inject further realism into the
design under uncertainty since some violations contribute to program risk more
strongly than others.

With respect to interesting studies, \gls{ro} opens up many possibilities to discover and analyze the benefits
of adaptable architectures in aircraft design versus more traditional point designs
when faced with parametric uncertainty. Some examples of these are modular designs, morphing designs,
adaptively manufactured designs and aircraft families. It is likely that these types of engineered
robustness become more

\section{Conclusion}

We have developed and applied a tractable RSP formulation to a simple aircraft model, and then discussed the benefits of having robust solutions. RSP formulations extend the tractable approximate RGP framework developed by Saab to non-log-convex problems, and are a valuable contribution to the fields of robust optimization and difference-of-convex programming.\\

RSPs have a wide variety of potential applications in engineering design. Within the Hoburg Research Group in the Aerospace Computational Design Lab, during the past year we have developed a commercial aircraft design SP that has between 1700 and 8000 variables, depending on the whether it is a single-point, or multi-point optimization. We expect that using RO in this conceptual aircraft design will result in designs that are more robust with respect to uncertainties in operational parameters, such as payload mass and range, as well as uncertain constants.

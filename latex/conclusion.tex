\section{Conclusion}

We have developed and applied a tractable \gls{rsp} formulation to a simple aircraft model,
and then discussed the benefits of having robust solutions. \gls{rsp} formulations extend
the tractable approximate RGP framework developed by Saab to non-log-convex problems,
and are a valuable contribution to the fields of robust optimization and difference-of-convex programming.\\

\gls{rsp}s have a wide variety of potential applications in engineering design.
We expect that using RO in this conceptual aircraft design will result in designs
that are more robust with respect to uncertainties in operational parameters,
such as payload mass and range, as well as uncertain environmental and manufacturing parameters. \gls{ro} also has
the potential to change current aerospace design paradigms by introducing
mathematical rigor to design under uncertainty, while still being tractable.

\section{Conclusion}

We have developed and applied a tractable \gls{rsp} formulation to a simple aircraft model,
and then discussed the benefits of having robust solutions. \gls{rsp} formulations extend
the tractable approximate RGP framework developed by Saab to non-log-convex problems,
and are a valuable contribution to the fields of robust optimization and difference-of-convex programming.\\

\gls{rsp}s have a wide variety of potential applications in engineering design.
Within the Hoburg Research Group in the Aerospace Computational Design Lab, during the past year we
have developed a commercial aircraft design \gls{sp} that has between 1700 and 8000 variables,
depending on the whether it is a single-point, or multi-point optimization.
We expect that using RO in this conceptual aircraft design will result in designs
that are more robust with respect to uncertainties in operational parameters,
such as payload mass and range, as well as uncertain constants.

@article{Hoburg2016,
abstract = {Motivated by practical applications in engineering, this article considers the problem of approximating a set of data with a function that is compatible with geometric programming (GP). Starting with well-established methods for fitting max-affine functions, it is shown that improved fits can be obtained using an extended function class based on the softmax of a set of affine functions. The softmax is generalized in two steps, with the most expressive function class using an implicit representation that allows fitting algorithms to locally tune softness. Each of the proposed function classes is directly compatible with the posynomial constraint forms in GP. Max-monomial fitting and posynomial fitting are shown to correspond to fitting special cases of the proposed implicit softmax function class. The fitting problem is formulated as a nonlinear least squares regression, solved locally using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Practical implementation considerations are discussed. The article concludes with numerical examples from aerospace engineering and electrical engineering.},

abstract = {A long-endurance, medium-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was designed to provide communication support to areas lacking communication infrastructure. Current solutions involve larger, more costly aircraft that carry heavier payloads and have maximum flight durations of less than 36 hours. The presented design would enable a 5.6 day mission with a 10 lb, 100 W communications payload, providing coverage over an area 100 km in diameter. A geometric program was used to size the aircraft, which is a piston-engine unmanned aircraft with a 24 ft wingspan, and a takeoff weight of 147 lbs. The airframe is designed to be modular, which allows for fast and easy transportation and assembly for an operating crew of four to six. The aircraft can station-keep in 90{\%} of global wind conditions at an altitude of 15,000 ft.},

abstract = {Stochastic optimization problems attempt to model uncertainty in the data by assuming that (part of) the input is specified in terms of a probability distribution. We consider the well-studied paradigm of 2-stage models with recourse: first, given only distributional information about (some of) the data one commits on initial actions, and then once the actual data is realized (according to the distribution), further (recourse) actions can be taken. We give the first approximation algorithms for 2-stage discrete stochastic optimization problems with recourse for which the underlying random data is given by a "black box" and no restrictions are placed on the costs in the two stages, based on an FPRAS for the LP relaxation of the stochastic problem (which has exponentially many variables and constraints). Among the range of applications we consider are stochastic versions of the set cover, vertex cover, facility location, multicut (on trees), and multicommodity flow problems.},

@article{Bertsimas2004,
abstract = {A robust approach to solving linear optimization problems with uncertain data has been proposed in the early 1970s, and has recently been extensively studied and extended. Under this approach, we are willing to accept a suboptimal solution for the nominal values of the data, in order to ensure that the solution remains feasible and near optimal when the data changes. A concern with such an approach is that it might be too conservative. In this paper we propose an approach that attempts to make this trade-off more attractive, that is we investigate ways to decrease what we call the price of robustness. In particular, we flexibly adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solutions in terms of probabilistic bounds of constraint violations. An attractive aspect of our method is that the new robust formulation is also a linear optimization problem. We thus naturally extend our methods to discrete optimization problems in a tractable way. We report numerical results for a portfolio optimization problem, a knapsack problem, and a problem from the Net Lib library.},

The text illustrates the breadth of the modeling and analysis capabilities that are supported by the software and support of complex real-world applications. Pyomo is an open source software package for formulating and solving large-scale optimization and operations research problems. The text begins with a tutorial on simple linear and integer programming models. A detailed reference of Pyomo's modeling components is illustrated with extensive examples, including a discussion of how to load data from data sources like spreadsheets and databases. Chapters describing advanced modeling capabilities for nonlinear and stochastic optimization are also included. The Pyomo software provides familiar modeling features within Python, a powerful dynamic programming language that has a very clear, readable syntax and intuitive object orientation. Pyomo includes Python classes for defining sparse sets, parameters, and variables, which can be used to formulate algebraic expressions that define objectives and constraints. Moreover, Pyomo can be used from a command-line interface and within Python's interactive command environment, which makes it easy to create Pyomo models, apply a variety of optimizers, and examine solutions. The software supports a different modeling approach than commercial AML (Algebraic Modeling Languages) tools, and is designed for flexibility, extensibility, portability, and maintainability but also maintains the central ideas in modern AMLs.},

abstract = {Aerodynamic shape optimization must consider multiple flight conditions to obtain designs that perform well in a range of situations. However, multipoint studies have relied on heuristic choices for the flight conditions and associated weights. To eliminate the heuristics, we propose a new approach where the conditions and weights are based on actual flight data. The proposed approach minimizes the expected drag value given by a probability density function in the space of the flight conditions, which can be estimated based on data from aircraft operations. To demonstrate our approach, we perform drag minimizations of the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group Common Research Model wing, for both single-point and multipoint cases. The multipoint cases include five- and nine-point formulations, some of which approximate the expected drag value over the specified flight-condition probability distribution. We conclude that if we focus on the resulting design, a five-point optimization with points based on the flight-condition distribution and equal weights is sufficient to obtain an optimal shape with respect to the expected drag value. However, if it is important to retain the accuracy of the expected drag integration at each optimization iteration, we recommend the proposed approach.},

@article{Hsiung2008,
abstract = {The optimal solution of a geometric program (GP) can be sensitive to variations in the problem data. Robust geometric programming can systematically alleviate the sensitivity problem by explicitly incorporating a model of data uncertainty in a GP and optimizing for the worst-case scenario under this model. However, it is not known whether a general robust GP can be reformulated as a tractable optimization problem that interior-point or other algorithms can efficiently solve. In this paper we propose an approximation method that seeks a compromise between solution accuracy and computational efficiency.The method is based on approximating the robust GP as a robust linear program (LP), by replacing each nonlinear constraint function with a piecewise linear (PWL) convex approximation. With a polyhedral or ellipsoidal description of the uncertain data, the resulting robust LP can be formulated as a standard convex optimization problem that interior-point methods can solve. The drawback of this basic method is that the number of terms in the PWL approximations required to obtain an acceptable approximation error can be very large. To overcome the "curse of dimensionality" that arises in directly approximating the nonlinear constraint functions in the original robust GP, we form a conservative approximation of the original robust GP, which contains only bivariate constraint functions. We show how to find globally optimal PWL approximations of these bivariate constraint functions.},

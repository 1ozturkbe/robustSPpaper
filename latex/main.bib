@article{Bertsimas2011,
abstract = {In this paper we survey the primary research, both theoretical and applied, in the area of Robust Optimization (RO). Our focus is on the computational attractiveness of RO approaches, as well as the modeling power and broad applicability of the methodology. In addition to surveying prominent theoretical results of RO, we also present some recent results linking RO to adaptable models for multi-stage decision-making problems. Finally, we highlight applications of RO across a wide spectrum of domains, including finance, statistics, learning, and various areas of engineering.},

@article{Higle1991,
abstract = {We present a cutting plane algorithm for two-stage stochastic linear programs with recourse. Motivated by Benders' decomposition, our method uses randomly generated observations of random variables to construct statistical estimates of supports of the objective function. In general, the resulting piecewise linear approximations do not agree with the objective function in finite time. However, certain subsequences of the estimated supports are shown to accumulate at supports of the objective function, with probability one. From this, we establish the convergence of the algorithm under relatively mild assumptions.},

@article{Pereira1991,
abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for the solution of multistage stochastic optimization problems, based on the approximation of the expected-cost-to-go functions of stochastic dynamic programming by piecewise linear functions. No state discretization is necessary, and the combinatorial “explosion” with the number of states (the well known “curse of dimensionality” of dynamic programming) is avoided. The piecewise functions are obtained from the dual solutions of the optimization problem at each stage and correspond to Benders cuts in a stochastic, multistage decomposition framework. A case study of optimal stochastic scheduling for a 39-reservoir system is presented and discussed.},

@article{Bertsimas2013,
abstract = {The last decade witnessed an explosion in the availability of data for operations research applications. Motivated by this growing availability, we propose a novel schema for utilizing data to design uncertainty sets for robust optimization using statistical hypothesis tests. The approach is flexible and widely applicable, and robust optimization problems built from our new sets are computationally tractable, both theoretically and practically. Furthermore, optimal solutions to these problems enjoy a strong, finite-sample probabilistic guarantee. $\backslash$edit{\{}We describe concrete procedures for choosing an appropriate set for a given application and applying our approach to multiple uncertain constraints. Computational evidence in portfolio management and queuing confirm that our data-driven sets significantly outperform traditional robust optimization techniques whenever data is available.}},

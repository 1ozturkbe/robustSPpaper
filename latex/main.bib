@article{Hoburg2016,
abstract = {Motivated by practical applications in engineering, this article considers the problem of approximating a set of data with a function that is compatible with geometric programming (GP). Starting with well-established methods for fitting max-affine functions, it is shown that improved fits can be obtained using an extended function class based on the softmax of a set of affine functions. The softmax is generalized in two steps, with the most expressive function class using an implicit representation that allows fitting algorithms to locally tune softness. Each of the proposed function classes is directly compatible with the posynomial constraint forms in GP. Max-monomial fitting and posynomial fitting are shown to correspond to fitting special cases of the proposed implicit softmax function class. The fitting problem is formulated as a nonlinear least squares regression, solved locally using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Practical implementation considerations are discussed. The article concludes with numerical examples from aerospace engineering and electrical engineering.},

We consider the well-studied paradigm of 2-stage models with recourse: first, given only distributional information about (some of) the data one commits on initial actions, and then once the actual data is realized (according to the distribution), further (recourse) actions can be taken. We give the first approximation algorithms for 2-stage discrete stochastic optimization problems with recourse for which the underlying random data is given by a "black box" and no restrictions are placed on the costs in the two stages, based on an FPRAS for the LP relaxation of the stochastic problem (which has exponentially many variables and constraints). Among the range of applications we consider are stochastic versions of the set cover, vertex cover, facility location, multicut (on trees), and multicommodity flow problems.},

abstract = {A robust approach to solving linear optimization problems with uncertain data has been proposed in the early 1970s, and has recently been extensively studied and extended. Under this approach, we are willing to accept a suboptimal solution for the nominal values of the data, in order to ensure that the solution remains feasible and near optimal when the data changes. A concern with such an approach is that it might be too conservative. In this paper we propose an approach that attempts to make this trade-off more attractive, that is we investigate ways to decrease what we call the price of robustness. In particular, we flexibly adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solutions in terms of probabilistic bounds of constraint violations. An attractive aspect of our method is that the new robust formulation is also a linear optimization problem. We thus naturally extend our methods to discrete optimization problems in a tractable way. We report numerical results for a portfolio optimization problem, a knapsack problem, and a problem from the Net Lib library.},

abstract = {Aerodynamic shape and aerostructural design optimizations that maximize the performance at a single flight condition may result in designs with unacceptable off-design performance. While considering multiple flight conditions in the optimization improves the robustness of the designs, there is a need to develop a way of choosing the flight conditions and their relative emphases such that multipoint optimizations reflect the true objective function. In addition, there is a need to consider uncertain missions and flight conditions. To address this, a new strategy to formulate multipoint design optimization problems is developed that can maximize the aircraft performance over a large number of different missions. This new strategy is applied to the high-fidelity aerostructural optimization of a long-range twin-aisle aircraft with the objective of minimizing the fuel burn over all the missions it performs in one year. This is accomplished by determining 25 flight conditions and their respective emphases on drag and structural weight that emulate the fuel-burn minimization for over 100,000 missions. The design optimization is based on the computational fluid dynamics of a full aircraft configuration coupled to a detailed finite element model of the wing structure, enabling the simultaneous optimization of wing aerodynamic shape and structural sizing leading to optimal static aeroelastic tailoring. A coupled adjoint method in conjunction with a gradient-based optimizer enable optimization with respect to 311 design variables subject to 152 constraints. Given the high computational cost of the aerostructural analysis, kriging models are used to evaluate the multiple missions. The results show that the multipoint optimized design reduced the total fuel burn by 6.6{\%}, while the single-point optimization reduced it by only 1.7{\%}. This capability to analyze large numbers of flight conditions and missions and to reduce the multimission problem to a multipoint problem could be used with a few modifications to minimize the expected value of any objective function given the probability density functions of the flight conditions.},

abstract = {Aerodynamic shape optimization must consider multiple flight conditions to obtain designs that perform well in a range of situations. However, multipoint studies have relied on heuristic choices for the flight conditions and associated weights. To eliminate the heuristics, we propose a new approach where the conditions and weights are based on actual flight data. The proposed approach minimizes the expected drag value given by a probability density function in the space of the flight conditions, which can be estimated based on data from aircraft operations. To demonstrate our approach, we perform drag minimizations of the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group Common Research Model wing, for both single-point and multipoint cases. The multipoint cases include five- and nine-point formulations, some of which approximate the expected drag value over the specified flight-condition probability distribution. We conclude that if we focus on the resulting design, a five-point optimization with points based on the flight-condition distribution and equal weights is sufficient to obtain an optimal shape with respect to the expected drag value. However, if it is important to retain the accuracy of the expected drag integration at each optimization iteration, we recommend the proposed approach.},

@article{Burton2017,
abstract = {Fueled by telecommunication needs and opportunities, there has been a recent push to develop aircraft that can provide long-endurance (days to weeks) persistent aerial cov-erage. These aircraft present a complicated systems engineering problem because of the multifaceted interaction of various requirements, such as endurance, wind speeds, opera-tional capability and coverage footprint. In this paper, a comparison of solar-electric and gas powered, long-endurance aircraft is accomplished. Geometric programming, a form of convex optimization, can reliably solve problems with thousands of variables in seconds and is used as an optimization tool to evaluate the design trade offs between architectures and requirements. The results show that long-endurance, gas powered aircraft are generally more robust to higher wind speeds than solar-powered aircraft. However, gas powered aircraft are limited in their endurance by the amount of fuel that they can carry. While solar-electric powered aircraft can theoretically fly for months, they are operationally lim-ited by reduced solar flux during the winter and wind speeds at higher latitudes. Using geometric programming, a detailed trade study between gas-powered and solar-powered aircraft is performed to discover which architecture is best suited to meet a given set of requirements, and what is the optimum size and endurance of that platform.

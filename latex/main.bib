@article{Bertsimas2011,
abstract = {In this paper we survey the primary research, both theoretical and applied, in the area of Robust Optimization (RO). Our focus is on the computational attractiveness of RO approaches, as well as the modeling power and broad applicability of the methodology. In addition to surveying prominent theoretical results of RO, we also present some recent results linking RO to adaptable models for multi-stage decision-making problems. Finally, we highlight applications of RO across a wide spectrum of domains, including finance, statistics, learning, and various areas of engineering.},

@article{Higle1991,
abstract = {We present a cutting plane algorithm for two-stage stochastic linear programs with recourse. Motivated by Benders' decomposition, our method uses randomly generated observations of random variables to construct statistical estimates of supports of the objective function. In general, the resulting piecewise linear approximations do not agree with the objective function in finite time. However, certain subsequences of the estimated supports are shown to accumulate at supports of the objective function, with probability one. From this, we establish the convergence of the algorithm under relatively mild assumptions.},

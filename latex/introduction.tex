\section{Introduction}

Robust optimization methods provide tractable methods to capture uncertainty in design.

The advantages of robust optimization methods over stochastic optimization methods
for optimization under uncertainty are summarized in \cite{Bertsimas2011}, 
and fall into three categories, which are tractability, conservativeness and flexibility.
There are
and this is due to the nature of uncertainty propagation
\gls{ro} is more tractable than \gls{so} since

The solution of the \gls{ro} problem is immune to the variations of the uncertain
parameters defined in the uncertainty set. This is powerful especially when distributional
information about the parameters is not available \cite{Bertsimas2011}.

Many kinds of optimization problems have tractable robust formulations, however




Geometric programming is a method of log-convex optimization for which robust formulations exist.
However, the stringent mathematical requirements of a \gls{gp} limits its application to non-log-convex problems.
The \gls{sp} is the difference-of-log-convex extension of the \gls{gp} which can be applied to
solve this larger set of problems, albeit with the loss of some mathematical guarantees compared to the \gls{gp}.
In this paper, we propose a tractable \gls{rsp} which we solve as a sequential \gls{rgp},
allowing us to implement robustness in non-log-convex problems.

\textbf{Why are SPs good for aircraft design?}

Aircraft pose some of the most challenging design problems. They have physics that span many disciplines,
and have many often conflicting objectives.

\textbf{Why is robust optimization a more rigorous method to integrate uncertainty in aircraft optimization?}

The effectiveness of an aircraft depends heavily on its
ability to deliver on performance, which is heavily dependent on assumptions about the
current technological environment and the ability to produce vehicles of a certain quality
Furthermore, aircraft design and development is costly, so the ability to handle uncertainty in
the conceptual design process is critical for the long-term success of an aircraft program.

TODO: Motivate the use of robust opt. for aircraft design over traditional methods, and stochastic/UQ.

Oftentimes, aerospace engineers will implement
margins in the design process to account for uncertainties in parameters that a design may be sensitive to,
without explicit knowledge of the trade-off between robustness and optimality~\cite{yao2011}.
In economics, the idea that risk is related to profit is well understood and leveraged.
In aerospace engineering however, we often forget that there is no such thing as a free lunch,
and that the consequence of risk-aversity
is often performance that is left on the table. The \gls{ro} frameworks proposed in this paper will
give aerospace engineers the ability to rigorously trade robustness and the performance penalties
that result from it.

\subsection{Contributions}

We extend the \gls{rgp} framework developed by Saab (TODO: cite) to \gls{sp}s.

We implement the \gls{rsp} formulation on a simple aircraft design problem with 19 free variables,
12 uncertain parameters and 17 constraints to demonstrate its potential (TODO: update).

A robust aircraft design formulation will allow designers to allocate margin more effectively
to obtain better-performing designs with feasibility guarantees.


The classical method of accounting for uncertainty in aerospace engineering is through
the use of \textit{margins}, which are essentially

This requires a skilled engineer to

However, this begs the question, who decides on the margins and

Robust optimization also relies on an engineer's intuition about the underlying uncertainty,

\section{Mathematical Background}
\subsection{Geometric Programming}
A \textbf{geometric program in posynomial form} is a log-convex optimization problem of the form:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	& \text{minimize} && f_0 \left(\vec{u}\right) \\
	& \text{subject to} && f_i \left(\vec{u}\right) \leq 1, i = 1,...,m_p\\
	& && h_i \left(\vec{u}\right) = 1, i = 1, ...,m_e\\
\end{aligned}
\label{GP_standard}
\end{equation}
where each $f_i$ is a {\em posynomial}, each $h_i$ is a {\em monomial}, $m_p$ is the number of posynomials, and $m_e$ is the number of monomials. A monomial $h(\vec{u})$ is a function of the form:
\begin{displaymath}
	h_i(\vec{u}) = e^{b_i}\textstyle{\prod}_{j=1}^{n}{u_j}^{a_{ij}}
\end{displaymath}
where $a_{ij}$ is the $j^{th}$ component of a row vector $\vec{a_i}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $u_j$ is the $j^{th}$ component of a column vector $\vec{u}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ , and $b_i$ is in $\mathbb{R}$. A posynomial $f(\vec{u})$ is the sum of $K \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ monomials:
\begin{displaymath}
	f_i(\vec{u}) = \textstyle{\sum_{k=1}^{K}}e^{b_{ikj}}\prod_{j=1}^{n}{u_j}^{a_{ikj}}
\end{displaymath}
where $a_{ikj}$ is the $j^{th}$ component of a row vector $\vec{a_{ik}}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $u_j$ is the $j^{th}$ component of a column vector $\vec{u}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n_+$, and $b_{ik}$ is in $\mathbb{R}$ \cite{GP_tutorial}.\\
A logarithmic change of the variables $x_j = \log(u_j)$ would turn a monomial into {\em  the exponential of an affine function} and a posynomial into {\em the sum of exponentials of affine functions}. A transformed monomial $h_i(\vec{x})$ is a function of the form:
\begin{displaymath}
    h_i(\vec{x}) = e^{\vec{a_i}\vec{x} + b_i}
\end{displaymath}
where $\vec{x}$ is a column vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. A transformed posynomial $f_i(\vec{x})$ is the sum of $K_i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ monomials:
\begin{displaymath}
    f_i(\vec{x}) = \textstyle{\sum_{k=1}^{K_i}}e^{\vec{a_{ik}}\vec{x} + b_{ik}}
\end{displaymath}
where $\vec{x}$ is a column vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. A geometric program with transformed constraints is a \textbf{geometric program in exponential form}.

The positive nature of exponential functions restricts the space spanned by posynomials and limits the applications of \gls{gp}s to certain classes of problems. The limited applicability of \gls{gp}s has motivated the introduction of signomials.

\subsection{Signomial Programming}
A {\em signomial} can be defined as the difference between two posynomials, consequently, an SP is a non-log-convex optimization problem of the form:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\text{minimize } && f_{0}(\vec{x}) \\
&\text{subject to } && f_{i}(\vec{x}) - g_{i}(\vec{x})& \leq 0, i = 1, ...., m \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 
where $f_{i}$ and $g_{i}$ are both posynomials, and $\vec{x}$ is a column vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. 

Reliably solving an SP to a local optimum has been described in \cite{GP_tutorial} and \cite{lipp_boyd_2015}. A common solution heuristic involves solving an SP as a sequence of GPs, where each GP is a local approximation of the SP. Although it is a powerful tool, applications involving SPs are usually prone to uncertainties that have a significant effect on the solution.

\subsection{Overview}

TODO: General optimization techniques for aircraft design

Signomial programming can cover constraints that might be neither linear, convex, nor log-covex and, hence, it can be used to model problems that cannot be formulated by standard optimization tools such as linear or geometric programs. Although global optimal solutions are not guaranteed, however, signomial programming is a powerful tool that is currently being used in modeling and solving complex aircraft designs quickly and reliably as in \cite{york_hoburg_drela_2018} \cite{kirschen_burnell_hoburg_2016} \cite{kirschen_york_ozturk_hoburg_2018}. Other interesting applications for SPs such as in network flow problems are being investigated.

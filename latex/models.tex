\section{Models}

We implemented the RSP formulation ideas above on a simple aircraft design problem, with 12 uncertain variables,
and a single signomial constraint. In the simple aircraft problem, we conduct an aerostructural
optimization of a wing and fuselage given a payload and range requirement. A short overview of the model follows.

\subsection{Lift, Weight, Drag and Thrust}

The aircraft is assumed to be in steady, level flight. As a result,
we can assume that the thrust generated by the aircraft is equal to the drag,
and the lift generated by the wing is equal to the total weight.

The drag is the sum of the wing (induced and profile) drag, and the fuselage drag,
which is linearly proportional to the fuel volume in the fuselage.
The aircraft model does not assume limitations on thrust, but instead assumes constant thrust specific fuel consumption,
at 0.6 lbs for each lb*hour of thrust, with associated uncertainty.

The weight of the aircraft is the sum of the payload weight, wing weight, and
the fuselage weight, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:liftweight}. Lift is generated by the wing,
which is described by an aspect ratio $AR$ and surface area $S$.

\subsection{Wing Structure}
The wing structure model is based on a simple beam model with a distributed lift load,
and a point mass in the center representing the fuselage, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:liftweight}.

\subsection{Fuel Volume}
The fuel in the aircraft can be stored either in the wing or the fuselage.
The signomial constraint in the optimization appears in the fuel volume model, as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:fuel}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fuel}
V_f \leq V_{f_{wing}} + V_{f_{fuse}} 
\end{equation}

where $V_{f_{wing}}$ and $V_{f_{fuse}}$ represent the fuel volume available in the wing
and the fuselage respectively. They are each represented by the following monomials.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fuelwing}
V_{f_{wing}} <= 9e^{-4}\frac{S^{1.5}\tau}{A^{0.5}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fuelfuse}
V_{f_{fuse}} <= 10 \times CDA_0~m
\end{equation}

Note that the monomials above are represented with inequalities, to be compatible with the RSP formulation. 

\subsection{Takeoff constraints}
We specify that the aircraft has to be able to takeoff at a speed of $V_{min}$
without exceeding the aircraft stall lift coefficient $C_{L_{max}}$, both of which are
specified with an associated uncertainty.

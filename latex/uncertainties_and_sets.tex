\section{Uncertainties and Sets}

The uncertainties for the different parameters in the problem have been determined
considering the parameters in aircraft design that often have the largest uncertainty.
These uncertainties, given by three times the \gls{cv}\footnote{The \gls{cv}
is defined as follows: $\text{CV} = \frac{\sigma}{|\mu|}$, where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation and $\mu$ is the mean of the parameter.},
are listed in Table~\ref{tab:uncertainties}. Since for the rest of this work
all standard deviations ($\sigma$) are normalized by the means of the parameters, we will use $3\sigma$
to represent $3\text{CV}$.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:uncertainties} Parameters and Uncertainties (increasing order)}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
\hline
Parameters & Description & Value & Units &\% Uncert. ($3\sigma$) \\
\hline
$S_{wetratio}$ & wetted area ratio & 2.075 & - & 3\\
e & span efficiency & 0.92 & - & 3\\
$\mu$ & viscosity of air & $1.78 \times 10^{-5}$ & $kg/(ms)$ & 4 \\
$\rho$ & air density & 1.23 & $kg/m^3$ & 5 \\
$C_{L_{max}}$ & stall lift coefficient & 1.6 & - & 5\\
k & fuselage form factor & 1.17 & - & 10\\
$\tau$ & airfoil thickness ratio & 0.12 & - & 10\\
$N_{ult}$ & ultimate load factor & 3.3 & - & 15\\
$V_{min}$ & takeoff speed & 25 & $m/s$ & 20\\
$W_0$ & payload weight & 6250 & $N$ & 20\\
$W_{w_{coeff,i}}$ & wing weight coefficient 1 & $2 \times 10^{-5}$ & $1/m$ & 20\\
$W_{w_{coeff,ii}}$ & wing weight coefficient 2 & 60 & $N/m^2$ & 20\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The parameter uncertainties reflect aerospace engineering intuition.
The wing weight coefficients $W_{w_{coeff,i}}$ and $W_{w_{coeff,ii}}$, and the ultimate load factor $N_{ult}$ have
large $3\sigma$s because the build quality of aircraft components is
often difficult to quantify with a large degree of certainty.
The payload weight ($W_0$) has a large uncertainty for similar reasons.
Parameters that engineers take to be
physical constants ($\mu$, $\rho$) and those that can be determined/manufactured with a relatively
high degree of accuracy ($S_{wetratio}$, $e$) have relatively low deviations.
Parameters that require testing to determine ($C_{L_{max}}$, $V_{min}$) have a level of uncertainty
that reflects the expected variance of empirical studies.

    Aircraft design benefits from optimization under uncertainty, since design feasibility
    and performance can have large sensitivities to uncertain parameters.
    Legacy methods of protecting against uncertainty do not adequately
    explain the trade-offs between feasibility and optimality, and require prior engineering knowledge
    which may not be available for novel aerospace vehicle concepts. {\color{blue}Furthermore,
    high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problems such as those in aircraft design
    are computationally intractable using stochastic optimization methods based on parameter
    probability distributions.}
    This paper proposes an efficient solution method
    for engineering design optimization problems under uncertainty using robust signomial programs (RSPs).
    {\color{blue} Signomial programs (SPs) have demonstrated
    potential in the solution of multidisciplinary non-convex optimization problems
    such as aircraft design, and the formulation of RSPs allows
    for conceptual engineering design that captures parametric uncertainty with
    probabilistic guarantees of design feasibility.}
    The proposed method transforms stochastic optimization problems to deterministic problems by considering
    the worst-case robust counterpart of each design constraint over a norm uncertainty set,
    {\color{blue} provided that each constraint is SP-representable}.
    The RSP formulation leverages an existing approximate robust geometric program (RGP)
    formulation and extends it by allowing difference-of-log-convex constraints that appear
    in many design problems.
    The {\color{blue} RSP is solved efficiently and deterministically using a sequence of local RGP
    approximations of the RSP}. RSPs are then implemented
    in an unmanned aircraft design problem, and
    used to rigorously explore the trade-off between robustness and optimality
    in aircraft design decisions.

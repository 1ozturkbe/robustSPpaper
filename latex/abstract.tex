    Aircraft design benefits greatly from optimization under uncertainty, since design feasibility
    and performance can have large sensitivities to uncertain parameters.
    The traditional, mathematically non-rigorous methods of capturing uncertainty do not adequately
    explain the trade-offs between feasibility and optimality, and require prior engineering knowledge
    which may not be available for novel aerospace vehicle concepts. This paper proposes a solution method
    for engineering design optimization problems under uncertainty using robust signomial programs (RSPs).
    The proposed RSP formulation leverages an existing approximate robust geometric programming (RGP)
    formulation developed by Saab,
    and extends it by allowing difference-of-log-convex constraints that appear
    in many design problems. Signomial programs have demonstrated
    potential in the solution of multidisciplinary non-convex optimization problems
    such as aircraft design, and
    the formulation and solution of robust signomial programs (RSPs) allows
    for conceptual engineering design that captures parametric uncertainty. The paper
    details the method which is based on solving a sequence of RGPs,
    where each RGP is a local approximation of the RSP. Then it explores
    the trade-off between robustness and optimality
    rigorously by implementing RSPs on a simple aircraft design problem, and demonstrates the effect of robustness
    requirements on aircraft design decisions.

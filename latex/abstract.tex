TODO: Complete rework to frame around AC design.

Signomial programming is useful in multidisciplinary non-convex optimization problems such as aircraft design. The formulation and solution of robust signomial programs (RSPs) would be beneficial since many parameters involved in these problems are prone to uncertainty, and can have significant effects on solution performance and feasibility. This paper proposes an approximate solution for an RSP leveraging an existing approximate robust geometric programming (RGP) formulation developed by Saab. The method is based on solving a sequence of RGPs, where each GP is a local approximation of the SP. Moreover, this paper also discusses the trade-off between robustness and optimality by implementing RSPs on a simple aircraft problem, and demonstrates how robust optimization affects aircraft design decisions.

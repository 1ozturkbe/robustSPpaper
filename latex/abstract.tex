    Aircraft design benefits from optimization under uncertainty, since design feasibility
    and performance can have large sensitivities to uncertain parameters.
    Legacy methods of capturing uncertainty do not adequately
    explain the trade-offs between feasibility and optimality, and require prior engineering knowledge
    which may not be available for novel aerospace vehicle concepts. This paper proposes a solution method
    for engineering design optimization problems under uncertainty using robust signomial programs (RSPs).
    The method transforms stochastic optimization problems to deterministic problems by considering
    the worst-case robust counterpart of each design constraint.
    The formulation leverages an existing approximate robust geometric program (RGP)
    formulation and extends it by allowing difference-of-log-convex constraints that appear
    in many design problems. Signomial programs have demonstrated
    potential in the solution of multidisciplinary non-convex optimization problems
    such as aircraft design, and
    the formulation of RSPs allows
    for conceptual engineering design that captures parametric uncertainty with
    probabilistic guarantees of design feasibility.
    The paper details a method based on solving a sequence of RGPs,
    where each RGP is a local approximation of the RSP. Then it explores
    the trade-off between robustness and optimality
    rigorously by implementing RSPs on an unmanned aircraft design problem, and evaluates the effect of robustness
    requirements on aircraft design decisions.

Aircraft design benefits greatly from optimization under uncertainty,
since design feasibility and performance can have large sensitivities to
uncertain parameters.
The traditional, mathematically non-rigorous methods of capturing uncertainty do not adequeately
explain the tradeoffs between feasibility and optimality, and require prior engineering knowledge
which may not be available for new aerospace vehicle concepts.
Robust signomial programs (RSPs) have been proposed as a method of nonlinear optimization
under uncertainty by Ozturk and Saab~\cite{Ozturk2019}, and can be applied successfully
to aircraft conceptual design problems~\cite{York2018}. This paper implements
the solution method from~\cite{Ozturk2019} to present a number of aircraft design studies
that are influenced by the presence of uncertainty, with the focus primarily on the trade-off
between robustness and optimality in aircraft design.

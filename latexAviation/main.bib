abstract = {In this paper we survey the primary research, both theoretical and applied, in the area of Robust Optimization (RO). Our focus is on the computational attractiveness of RO approaches, as well as the modeling power and broad applicability of the methodology. In addition to surveying prominent theoretical results of RO, we also present some recent results linking RO to adaptable models for multi-stage decision-making problems. Finally, we highlight applications of RO across a wide spectrum of domains, including finance, statistics, learning, and various areas of engineering.},

abstract = {We present a cutting plane algorithm for two-stage stochastic linear programs with recourse. Motivated by Benders' decomposition, our method uses randomly generated observations of random variables to construct statistical estimates of supports of the objective function. In general, the resulting piecewise linear approximations do not agree with the objective function in finite time. However, certain subsequences of the estimated supports are shown to accumulate at supports of the objective function, with probability one. From this, we establish the convergence of the algorithm under relatively mild assumptions.},

No state discretization is necessary, and the combinatorial “explosion” with the number of states (the well known “curse of dimensionality” of dynamic programming) is avoided. The piecewise functions are obtained from the dual solutions of the optimization problem at each stage and correspond to Benders cuts in a stochastic, multistage decomposition framework. A case study of optimal stochastic scheduling for a 39-reservoir system is presented and discussed.},

abstract = {The last decade witnessed an explosion in the availability of data for operations research applications. Motivated by this growing availability, we propose a novel schema for utilizing data to design uncertainty sets for robust optimization using statistical hypothesis tests. The approach is flexible and widely applicable, and robust optimization problems built from our new sets are computationally tractable, both theoretically and practically. Furthermore, optimal solutions to these problems enjoy a strong, finite-sample probabilistic guarantee. $\backslash$edit{\{}We describe concrete procedures for choosing an appropriate set for a given application and applying our approach to multiple uncertain constraints. Computational evidence in portfolio management and queuing confirm that our data-driven sets significantly outperform traditional robust optimization techniques whenever data is available.}},

abstract = {An approximate formulation of a robust geometric program (RGP) as a convex program is proposed. Interest in using geometric programs (GPs) to model complex engineering systems has been growing, and this has motivated explicitly modeling the uncertainties fundamental to engineering design optimization. RGPs provide a framework for modeling and solving GPs while representing their uncertainties as belonging to an uncertainty set. The RGP methodologies presented here are based on reformulating the GP and then robustifying it with methods from robust linear programming. These new methodologies, along with previous ones from the literature, are used to robustify two aircraft design problems, and the results of these different methodologies are compared and discussed.},

@article{Burton2017,
abstract = {Fueled by telecommunication needs and opportunities, there has been a recent push to develop aircraft that can provide long-endurance (days to weeks) persistent aerial cov-erage. These aircraft present a complicated systems engineering problem because of the multifaceted interaction of various requirements, such as endurance, wind speeds, opera-tional capability and coverage footprint. In this paper, a comparison of solar-electric and gas powered, long-endurance aircraft is accomplished. Geometric programming, a form of convex optimization, can reliably solve problems with thousands of variables in seconds and is used as an optimization tool to evaluate the design trade offs between architectures and requirements. The results show that long-endurance, gas powered aircraft are generally more robust to higher wind speeds than solar-powered aircraft. However, gas powered aircraft are limited in their endurance by the amount of fuel that they can carry. While solar-electric powered aircraft can theoretically fly for months, they are operationally lim-ited by reduced solar flux during the winter and wind speeds at higher latitudes. Using geometric programming, a detailed trade study between gas-powered and solar-powered aircraft is performed to discover which architecture is best suited to meet a given set of requirements, and what is the optimum size and endurance of that platform.

% `template.tex', a bare-bones example employing the AIAA class.
%
% For a more advanced example that makes use of several third-party
% LaTeX packages, see `advanced_example.tex', but please read the
% Known Problems section of the users manual first.
%
% Typical processing for PostScript (PS) output:
%
%  latex template
%  latex template   (repeat as needed to resolve references)
%
%  xdvi template    (onscreen draft display)
%  dvips template   (postscript)
%  gv template.ps   (onscreen display)
%  lpr template.ps  (hardcopy)
%
% With the above, only Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) images can be used.
%
% Typical processing for Portable Document Format (PDF) output:
%
%  pdflatex template
%  pdflatex template      (repeat as needed to resolve references)
%
%  acroread template.pdf  (onscreen display)
%
% If you have EPS figures, you will need to use the epstopdf script
% to convert them to PDF because PDF is a limmited subset of EPS.
% pdflatex accepts a variety of other image formats such as JPG, TIF,
% PNG, and so forth -- check the documentation for your version.
%
% If you do *not* specify suffixes when using the graphicx package's
% \includegraphics command, latex and pdflatex will automatically select
% the appropriate figure format from those available.  This allows you
% to produce PS and PDF output from the same LaTeX source file.
%
% To generate a large format (e.g., 11"x17") PostScript copy for editing
% purposes, use
%
%  dvips -x 1467 -O -0.65in,0.85in -t tabloid template
%
% For further details and support, read the Users Manual, aiaa.pdf.


% Try to reduce the number of latex support calls from people who
% don't read the included documentation.

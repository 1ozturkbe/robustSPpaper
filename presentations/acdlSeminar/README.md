# AeroAstro-template
Latex Beamer template for AeroAstro presentations

## Compiling
Build using `make` for a quick build.  
Build using `make all` to also build references.

## Advice
If you use a Mac you can use [PDF to Keynote](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/freesoftware/pdftokeynote.html) to convert your slides to .key format. This allows you to present using a highly-configurable presenter view.
